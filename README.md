# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
A collection of Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms and experiments — including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection — implemented from scratch and using scikit-learn. Focused on visual understanding and real-world datasets.
# 🧩 Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations and experiments with **Unsupervised Machine Learning** algorithms — where models discover hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled data.

## 🔍 Overview

Unsupervised learning helps in understanding data by finding similarities, clusters, and patterns without predefined labels.  
This project demonstrates core unsupervised techniques with step-by-step code and visualization.

## 🚀 Features

  - t-SNE Visualization
- **Anomaly Detection**
  - Isolation Forest
  - One-Class SVM
- **From Scratch Implementations**
  - Custom K-Means using NumPy
  - Manual PCA with Eigen Decomposition

## 🧠 Datasets Used
- Iris Dataset  
- Mall Customer Segmentation Data  
- Credit Card Fraud Detection (for anomaly detection)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
